# Wordwhiz - Word Guessing Game (Wordle Clone)

## Overview
**Wordwhiz** is a terminal-based word guessing game inspired by Wordle, built using C++. The game allows players to guess a word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the correctness of the letters, helping players narrow down their options.

## Features
- **Word Guessing**: Players must guess the correct word.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user enters a valid word (e.g guess a four-letter word).
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Displays feedback on correct letters in the correct position and letters that are correct but in the wrong position.
- **Game Logic**: Players have six attempts to guess the correct word.
- **Random Word Selection**: The game selects a random word from a predefined list of words.
- **Terminal-Based Interface**: A simple text-based interface for interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Features**: Standard C++ libraries (STL) for handling I/O operations and random word selection.
