1. Start the Wordle Game

2. Define a struct GameInfo:
   - secretWord (string)
   - attemptsLeft (integer)

3. Define a template class WordList:
   - Template Type T
   - Template Parameter N (maximum number of words)

4. Create a WordList object to load words from "wordlist.txt":
   - Initialize with the template type as string and N as 1000 (maximum words)
   - Load words from the file into an array

5. Seed the random number generator with the current time

6. Generate a random secretWord by:
   - Selecting a random word from the loaded word list

7. Initialize attemptsLeft to 6

8. Define three self-defined functions:
   - Function 1: Check if a guess is correct (IsCorrectGuess)
   - Function 2: Calculate and display a hint (DisplayHint)
   - Function 3: Load words from a file into an array (LoadWords)

9. Display a welcome message using formatted output:
   - "Welcome to Wordle! You have 6 attempts to guess the secret word."

10. Start the game loop:
    - Repeat while attemptsLeft is greater than 0

    11. Display the attempt number using formatted output:
        - "Attempt #: " followed by (7 - attemptsLeft)

    12. Get a guess from the player through input:
        - Read a string from the player's input

    13. Check if the guess length is not equal to the secretWord length using conditional statements:
        - If not equal:
            - Display an error message using formatted output: "Invalid guess length. Please guess a [length]-letter word."
            - Continue to the next iteration of the loop

    14. Check if the guess is correct using the IsCorrectGuess function:
        - If the guess matches the secretWord:
            - Display a congratulatory message with the secretWord using formatted output
            - Exit the game loop

    15. Calculate and display a hint using the DisplayHint function:
        - For each character in the guess:
            - If the character is correct in both position and letter:
                - Append the character to the hint
            - Else, if the character is in the secretWord but in the wrong position:
                - Append "+" to the hint
            - Else, the character is not in the secretWord:
                - Append "-" to the hint
        - Display the hint using formatted output

    16. Decrement attemptsLeft by 1

11. End the game loop

12. Check if attemptsLeft reached 0 using conditional statements:
    - If yes:
        - Display a game over message with the secretWord using formatted output
    - If no:
        - The player won, display a winning message with the secretWord using formatted output

13. End the Wordle Game
